    FILEUPLOAD-283: add tests for the portlet package

    Initial tests for the portlet package. I believe there have been updates to the portlet specification(s) that have not been applied to Commons FileUpload yet. Hopefully, having unit tests will help us later when changing the package.
    
    Removed strings like ""US-ASCII"" using the `StandardCharsets` class from Java 7.
    
    There was a class -`FileUploadTestCase`- that was extended by other tests. But it became problematic as there were tests that would be common to any implementation of `FileUpload`, while other tests were specific to `ServletFileUpload`.
    
    This pull request removed the inheritance from the tests, by a `Util` class (open to other suggestions) with methods for parsing uploads and for tests.
    
    Tests related to `ServletFileUpload` are now in `ServletFileUploadTest`, in the `.servlet` package in the test sources.
    
    Tests related to `PortletFileUpload` are now in `PortletFileUploadTest`, in the `.portlet` package in the test sources.
    
    There are no functional changes in the tests. Coverage remained the same for other classes. For the `.portlet` package, it went from 0% to 60% in my local working copy.
    
    There are lots of other parts that need better coverage, but at least I think having tests in separated classes will make it slightly easier to add more.
    
    Cheers
    Bruno

If any operations are performed on the corresponding file object from DiskFileItem#getStoreLocation() a FileNotFoundException is thrown.

FileUploadBase#parseRequest() copies the multipart file input stream to the temporary file output stream with Streams#copy(). This method only creates the temporary file on the file system if data is written to the file's output stream. Since the input stream is empty, write is never called on the output stream and the temporary file is not created.

I've used the following snippet to overcome this issue. This ensures the temporary file is created on the file system prior to writing:

Thanks for the report.","19/Aug/15 17:29;jonenst;The section also has
""
Disabling cleanup of temporary files

To disable tracking of temporary files, you may set the FileCleaningTracker to null. Consequently, created files will no longer be tracked. In particular, they will no longer be deleted automatically.
""
But disabling the tracking is not enough to prevent the file associated with DiskFileItem to be deleted because DiskFileItem also has a finalize method which gets called by the garbage collector at some point anyway.

So I would add in the intro
""
This is done silently either by the org.apache.commons.io.FileCleaner class, which starts a reaper thread, or by the finalize() method of DiskFileItem, whichever is called first. Using the reaper thread is optional. To use the reaper thread, see below. Usually, using the reaper thread allows to remove the files earlier and more deterministically than waiting for the garbage collector to call the finalize() method. It is not possible to disable the cleanup of temporary files when DiskFileItem is garbage collected.
